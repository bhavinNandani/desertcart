# [Desertcart](https://www.desertcart.ae/) Coding challenge,

# There are 2 Parts in the challenge
- Part I: This part contains the Coding challenge
    - Write String reverse function
    - Write Function to extract Date time from JSON with a specific format.
    - Write a Fibonacci function that could accept the big number and take less time to process
- Part II: This part contains technical questions
    - This part contains some senior-level questions like how you use to implement a new feature in an existing application, what procedure you will follow, handling the team, etc


## Tips and Overview
- This was an online coding challenge and I have assigned 75 minutes to complete the task
- One technical person from desertcart connected over a video call, the developer should share their screen, and the video should be on, Interview start with an introduction.
- Pro tip: Spend too low time introducing yourself because once the meeting is started intro is also combined with the 75 minutes, In my case, I introduced myself and also describe my best projects so due to this I got short of time and I was able to complete only part I, for Part 2 I hardly get 5 minute.
- Negative part: After the interview, you did not get any post-interview mail, till now I haven't got any rejection mail from the desertcart team, I email them twice or thrice but after pinning the Tiger Recruitment person (who connected to me initially) I got to know that I am rejected.
